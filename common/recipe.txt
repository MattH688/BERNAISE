Bearnaise Sauce
(Sauce bearnaise a la Paul Bocuse)

Serves 4 to 6

Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes

3 medium shallots
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped tarragon
1 pinch chopped chervil
4 egg yolks
250 g unsalted butter
Salt and freshly crushed pepper

This sauce must be made over very low heat, just before serving.
Making it in a double boiler will ensure good results:
Use the top of the double boiler as an ordinary pot for the first stage of making the sauce.

Peel and finely chop the shallots.
Place the vinegar, shallots, chopped tarragon and chervil (setting aside a little of both for the end), a little salt and a pinch of freshly crushed pepper in the top part of the double boiler.
Place over high heat and reduce until you have the equivalent of 2 teaspoons left in the pan.
Remove from the heat and leave to cool completely before finishing the sauce (you can speed cooling by holding the pot in a bowl of ice water).

Whisk the egg yolks, one by one, and 2 tablespoons of cold water into the vinegar mixture.
Heat a little water in the bottom of the double boiler and set the top part in place.

Break the butter into small pieces.
Whisk in a piece of the butter, the continue adding the rest of the butter little by little, whisking constantly.
The sauce should become foamy at first, then thicken as the butter is added. Keep warm over warm hot-water bath.

Just before serving, add salt and pepper, if needed and the remaining tarragon and chervil. Serve in a sauceboat.

Note: this sauce should be much thicker than a Hollandaise sauce; it has more egg yolks.
It should have the consistency as Dijon mustard.

Serving suggestions: This is the perfect sauce for any grilled meat.
