i. Formulat the dimensionless equation
    Find the equations The do the following!  
        - Do it for Nerst-Plack
        - Do it for Poisson
        - Do it for Stokes
        - Do it for the phase field 

1. Phase Field (Gaute)
    There is proberly a way to do this!
        - Make input for velosity 
        - add maybe contact angel
        - make unit test for stright capilar   
        - make unit test for barbell capilar 

2. Mesh genration (Asger)
    stright forward!
        X Make stright capilar 
        - Make the barbell capilar
        - Make unit test 

3. Timedependet Stokes 
    stright forward!
        - Make space for both electic force, interface force and spacedependet viscosity(the two phases)
        - make unit test for stright capilar   
        - make unit test for barbell capilar  

4. Stady State Poisson Nerst-Plack (Asger)  
    a bit invold but have som legacy code!
        - Make it woke with spacedependet permativity and spacedependet defusion constats (the two phases)
        - make unit test for barbell capilar  

5. Timedependet Poisson Nerst-Plack 
    A new thing pu proberly ok to deal with!
        - Make it woke with spacedependet permativity and spacedependet defusion constats (the two phases)
        - make unit test for barbell capilar  

6. Put it all togeter!
    A bit diffcault to say at present how that is gonna go dwon!
        - Make config file and sauce.py work
