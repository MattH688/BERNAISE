i. Formulate the dimensionless equation
    Find the equations, then do the following:  
        X Do it for Nernst-Planck
        X Do it for Poisson
        X Do it for Stokes
        - Do it for the phase field 

1. Phase Field (Gaute)
    There is properly a way to do this!
        - Make input for velosity 
        - add maybe contact angel
        - make unit test for stright capilar   
        - make unit test for barbell capilar 

2. Mesh genration (Asger)
    stright forward!
        X Make stright capilar 
        X Make the barbell capilar
        X Make mesh load function 
        - Make unit test 

3. Time-dependent Stokes 
    straight forward!
        - Make space for both electic force, interface force and spacedependet viscosity(the two phases)
        - make unit test for stright capilar   
        - make unit test for barbell capilar  

4. Stady-state Poisson-Nernst-Plack (Asger)  
    a bit invold but have som legacy code!
        - Make it woke with spacedependet permativity and spacedependet defusion constats (the two phases)
        - make unit test for barbell capilar  

5. Timedependet Poisson Nerst-Plack 
    A new thing pu proberly ok to deal with!
        - Make it woke with spacedependet permativity and spacedependet defusion constats (the two phases)
        - make unit test for barbell capilar  

6. Put it all togeter!
    A bit diffcault to say at present how that is gonna go dwon!
        - Make config file and sauce.py work
